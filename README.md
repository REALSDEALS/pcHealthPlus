## What is the main purpose of pcHealthPlus?

pcHealthPlus is an extension/rewrite of the original pcHealth script. The main purpose of pcHealthPlus is to assist 'users' that are working in the IT business to run some simple things to check the system on defaults. Besides that you can download some simple programs (that are well known) to assist you in a deeper investigation of the system. This script is purely to enlighten the work in the workfield, exspecially for repetetive things like this.
